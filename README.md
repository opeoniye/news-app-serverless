## Triple Love News App
Project running on [Netlify](https://news-bams.netlify.app/)

The app is a simple news app that fetches news content via an API and displays the news content to the client/user. The user of the app needs to authenticate and login before news contents can be `loaded`, `viewed`, `added` or `deleted`.

The app is a serverless service built on AWS Lambda and deployed using [Serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/)
