# Triple Love News Serverless App
This project is my final project in the Udacity Cloud Developer Nanodegree program. The app is a simple news app that fetches news content via an AWS ApiGateway api and displays the news content to the client/user. The user of the app needs to authenticate and login before news contents can be `loaded`, `viewed`, `added` or `deleted`. \
This is a Serverless project deployed using the Serverless Framework(https://www.serverless.com/)
